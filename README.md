# Enhanced-API
I enhanced the original code by expanding the textContent fields to include much longer, more realistic student notes and article-style content. I also added a new /summary/:id route that uses the OpenAI API to generate concise, student-friendly summaries. These summaries are then stored directly in each podcast object, making the data more useful and dynamic.
